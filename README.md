# Inferno


Inferno is a Slackbot-enabled LED flame, running on ESP8266 hardware. It's designed for use in a modded 100% Soft's [Dumpster Fire - This is Fine](https://100soft.shop/products/dumpster-fire-this-is-fine-vinyl-figure)  vinyl figure and for integration with Slack-based alerting. In addition to Slack integration, Inferno also provides a web server to control and display status.

The flame effect is achieved by using an eight RGB LED disc with WS2812B LEDs. Random LEDs are periodically assigned a random flame intensity and faded out. A piece of baking paper is used to diffuse the LEDs.

## Usage

When first turned on, Inferno creates a WiFi AP called `Inferno`. Connect to this in order to select an internet-enabled WiFi network for Inferno to join. If a saved WiFi network is not available on startup, this AP will be created.

### Slack 

Assuming a Slack bot has been created with the name `@Inferno`, the following commands are honoured:

* `@Inferno on` turn on flame 
* `@Inferno off` turn off flame, enable monitoring mode
* `@Inferno party` turn on rainbow colour cycling
* `@Inferno reset` reset to flame effect

Additionally, if the text `[Alerting]` or `Triggered:` appears in any Slack channel that the Slack bot is a member of, Inferno turns on for a predefined period of time.

### Web server

Inferno creates a web server on port 80. Issuing a `GET` will list the available commands:

```
    ,.   (   .      )        .      "
   ("     )  )'     ,'        )  . (`     '`
 .; )  ' (( (" )    ;(,     ((  (  ;)  "  )"
 _"., ,._'_.,)_(..,( . )_  _' )_') (. _..( '..
 
GET  /status        get LED status
POST /off           turn LEDs off
POST /on            turn LEDS on
POST /monitor       enable monitoring
```

## Building

Inferno depends on Arduino libraries to run. It is recommended to set the ESP8266's clock to 160 Mhz due to the use of SSL.

### Flash

The contents of the `data` folder should be uploaded to flash. In addition, Inferno expects the following files to be present in flash:

* `data/secrets/slackBotId.txt`
* `data/secrets/slackToken.txt`

These files should contain a single line containg the Slack bot id and OAuth tokens, respectively.

### LED pins

LED pin assignment is defined in `Inferno.h`. Pin to GPIO mappings can be found [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-pinout-reference-gpios/). Inferno relies on PWM for the flame effect, so the LEDs need to be connected to GPIO pins which can provide PWM.
